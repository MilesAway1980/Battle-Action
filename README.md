# Battle-Action

Battle Action is a Unity recreation of an older multiplayer game that I first made in QB64, then recreated in C++/SDL.  
It is the first time, however, that it is playable over a network, using Unity's new UNET.
Eventually, it will be modified for tablet/phone play, as well as a co-op main game.
For now, however, it is simply a deathmatch setup.
